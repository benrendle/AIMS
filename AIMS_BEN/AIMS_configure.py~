#
# This variable must be a list (or tuple) of pairs of strings.  The first
# string corresponds to the name of the variable which should be used, for
# instance, in the grid_params and output_params variables.  The second
# string is the fancy latex name for this variable.  Allowance needs to
# be made for a prefix and and postfix (hence the two "%s").  These will
# be replaced by appropriate strings if, for instance, one asks for the
# log of this parameter.
