#########################   Parallelisation   ##############################

#       parallelisation using the "parallel" parameter.

# Ranges used around tight ball configuration for walkers.
# NOTES:
#   - if ranges are not provided, AIMS will comme up with its own default
#     ranges (typically 1/30th of the total range for the relevant parameter,
#     centred around the value from the best grid model)
#   - if ranges are provided, they will be re-centred around the parameters
#     of the best model in the grid
#   - the ranges on parameters related to surface amplitudes will be reset by AIMS
#   - exact names should be used as keys, since AIMS accesses
#     the relevant distributions by using the name as a key.
#   - it doesn't matter if there are supplementary parameters
#     which don't intervene. AIMS will simply ignore them.

#########################   User-defined parameters   ######################

# addition to the parameters hard-coded in to AIMS.  These parameters
# can then be used as output parameters (see output_params) and/or even
# as grid parameters used to define evolutionary tracks (see grid_params).
#
# This variable must be a list (or tuple) of pairs of strings.  The first
# string corresponds to the name of the variable which should be used, for
# instance, in the grid_params and output_params variables.  The second
# string is the fancy latex name for this variable.  Allowance needs to
# be made for a prefix and and postfix (hence the two "%s").  These will
# be replaced by appropriate strings if, for instance, one asks for the
# log of this parameter.

#########################   Priors    ######################################
# The priors are given in a similar format as the tight-ball ranges above.
# An important difference is that the relevant probability distributions
# will not be recentred or renormalised (in the case of surface term
# amplitudes).
#
# NOTES:
#   - if a prior on a given parameter is not provided, AIMS will comme
#     up with its own default prior, namely an uniformative prior if
#     the tight_ball option is set to True, and a uniform prior on a
#     relevant range in the opposite case (except for parameters
#     related to surface corrections, in which case AIMS explicitely asks
#     the user to provide a prior).
#   - exact names should be used as keys, since AIMS accesses
#     the relevant distributions by using the name as a key
#   - it doesn't matter if there are supplementary parameters
#     which don't intervene. AIMS will simply ignore them.
