=================

  * Click :download:`here <./files/AIMS.tgz>` to download AIMS.
  * The contents of this file may then be extracted via the command::

     tar -zxvf AIMS.tgz

  * This will lead to the creation of a folder called ``AIMS`` and
    a subfolder called ``AIMS/doc``.

    - the ``AIMS`` folder contains the AIMS program; it is from this
      folder that AIMS is launched.
    - the ``AIMS\doc`` folder is where the documentation is generated.
      Typing ``make html`` within this folder will generate this web
      page in ``AIMS/doc/_build/html/``.  Typing ``make latexpdf``
      will generate a pdf version of this documentation in
      ``AIMS/doc/_build/latex/AIMS.pdf``.
