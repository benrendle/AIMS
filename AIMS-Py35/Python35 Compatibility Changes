Occurences of print "text" changed to print("text")
{print "text" not supported in Python 3}

Occurences of xrange() changed to range()
{range in Python 3 received same function as xrange in Python 2, xrange no longer exists in Python 3}

Line 723 in AIMS.py:
 add_constraint(self,(name,distribution)):
changed to
 add_constraint(self,name_distribution):
and tuple is unpacked inside function as
 name, distribution = name_distribution
{tuple parameter unpacking no longer permitted in Python 3}

Tab spacing that was permitted in Python 2 prevented code execution in Python 3 and has been fixed

Changed file read/write from "r"/"w" to "rb"/"wb" respectively
{Python 3 reads from/writes to files differently to Python 2}

Model binaries have to be written again
{old binaries generated using Python 2 incompatible with Python 3}

All occurences of map() changed to list(map())
{Python 2 map() returns object of type 'list' but Python 3 map() returns interator object of type 'map'}
{which raises an error for functions expecting type 'list' so map iterator must first be converted to list}

Occurences of zip() changed to list(zip()) where the intended assignment was of a 'list' type
{Python 2 zip() returns object of type 'list' but Python 3 zip() returns interator object of type 'zip'}
{which raises an error for functions expecting type 'list' so zip iterator must first be converted to list}

duplicate_ages() checks models within the track in pairs, if a single model track is checked for duplicates,
it returns None and this breaks the code. if statement was inserted to detect and flag up single model tracks

List and tuple formatting in write_readme() changed by embedding list/tuple in str()
{Python 3 raised TypeError when a list/tuple was not explicitly converted into string representation}

Integer division where the desired result is an integer has correct // symbol.
{Python 3 division returns a 'float' type even if division is between two integers.
